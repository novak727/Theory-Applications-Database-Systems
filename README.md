# Theory and Applications of Database Systems
This repository holds all files created throughout my Database Systems class.

For Homework problems, the original problems are included, however only the SQL files that were created for the homework have also been provided. No other files for each homework assignment has been provided.

You will need [MySQL 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) to run these files.
